I am Stefano Mandelli, and I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Milan. My primary research topic concern about CMB phenomenology in particular in the findings of PGW (Primordial Gravitational Waves) in the CMB signal.


The researcher in cosmology field is the most beautiful work in the world. Every day I have the opportunity to observe and study the most ancient photons of our Universe. Yes! It is amazing! By the way, the CMB radiation shows a very early Universe, in particular, show a 380.000-year-old universe!

A very much young universe, if it is compared with its actual age of (after the Planck last estimation) 13.813 billions of years.


For this reason, in the CMB radiation is coded the whole thermal story of our universe since its start from the age of radiation/matter decoupling.


After this period the density of the universe was too high to permit a free-vacuum propagation to the photons that were constrained in a vast sea of plasma by continuous scattering interactions. Since the density was down allowing the propagation of the firsts photons was forming quasi-isotropic radiation that now we can observe it in the Microwave bands, and we know as Cosmic Microwave Radiation.


This very faint radiation appear as quasi-isotropic and homogeneous due to inflation huge stretching....yes quasi-homogeneous! With more carefully observations, in particular by  COBE, WMAP and PLANCK in the last, was raised the evidence of small fluctuations in temperature and polarization.


The temperature fluctuations were due to the plasma oscillations on the very early universe, while the polarization fluctuations can hide a definite proof that came across with a smoking gun in the thriller police films, for the inflation theory.
